# Kink_and_BDSM_Pride_Flags

Kink and BDSM pride flags emojis, primarily made for use on Mastodon.<br>
All images are reworked to 128x128 with transparent background, the flag portion of each image is 128x96 all are sub 2kB

These images have been lovingly created to spread awareness of BDSM and Kinks.<br>
A lot of research has been made to try and find the original creators, but some remain unknown.<br>
If you know of a creator who wants to be credited for their work, please let me know. (provide some sort of verification)<br>
If you are a creator who owns a copyright to any of the originals and wants it removed, please let me know and I will remove them ASAP (Provide some sort of verification)<br>

This work has been done to the best of my abilities, I apologize if I have gotten any information wrong.<br>
If you feel that I have missed any relevant flags, pleas let me know and I will add them.<br>

When not superseded by another license below, all images are Public Domain.<br>

Historically "Master" and "Slave" has been used in BDSM culture, this is today seen as offensive by many people so "Dom"/"Dominant" and "Sub"/"Submissive" seen as better descriptors today.<br>
The quotes and websites below were written in another time when this was not seen as a problem.<br>
Please do not be offended by what they wrote 10-20 years ago.<br>

This is a list of the creators of the original works used as a base for these images.<br>
